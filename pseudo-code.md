# Pseudo Code
```cpp
void setup () {
    // Setup all pins
}

void loop () {
    // Check if main switch is on
    // Check if rotary encoder has been rotated
    // Check if rotary encoder has been pressed

    // Based on all these observations, make the appropriated changes
    // to the variables which controls this

    // Set all values, according to the variables
